## Overview

  Objective of this assignment is to create a Solidity smart contract that manages the entire end-to-end crowdsale process, allowing users to send the Ether to the contract and in return receive KASE, i.e. my new KaseiCoin tokens. The contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in a single transaction.
  
 ## Technologies

The code is written in Solidity version 0.5.0, successfully deployed and tested using below technologies.

Solidity - to create the smart contract, compile and deploy onto my private local blockchain network

MetaMask - my software cryptocurrency wallet

Ganache - my personal blockchain for application development

 ## Execution Results
